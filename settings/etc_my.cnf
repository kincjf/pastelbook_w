# Settings user and group are ignored when systemd is used.
# If you need to run mysqld under a different user or group,
# customize your systemd unit file for mysqld/mariadb according to the
# instructions in http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd

# Currently, there are mariadb and community-mysql packages in Fedora.
# This particular config file is included in respective RPMs of both of them,
# so the following settings are general and will be also used by both of them.
# Otherwise the RPMs would be in conflict.
# Settings for particular implementations like MariaDB are then
# defined in appropriate sections; for MariaDB server in [mariadb] section in
# /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf (part of mariadb-server).
# It doesn't matter that we set these settings only for [mysqld] here,
# because they will be read and used in mysqld_safe as well.
